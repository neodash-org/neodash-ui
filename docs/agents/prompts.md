# Prompts & Rules

- Prefer concise, skimmable responses; code in fenced blocks where appropriate.
- Use `.cursor/rules/design.mdc` for UI/UX decisions.
- Default to parallel info-gathering; avoid unnecessary confirmations.
- Before edits, state assumptions; after, summarize high-signal changes.
- Enforce type safety, retries, caching, and centralized error handling.
